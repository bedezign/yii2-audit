Yii2 Audit records and displays web/cli requests, database changes, php/js errors and associated data.

## Abandoned

It was probably already clear, but I'm not able to support this project anymore.
I gave up Yii(2) for Laravel almost 6 years ago. Haven't even been using PHP for the last 3 years.
So, if anyone supporting one of the forks wants to take lead on this project, let me know and we can probably work something out.

## PHP7.2 & Yii 2.0.13 or later

From `PHP 7.2` on `Object` became a reserved keyword. 
Since enough time went by, we decided to assume everyone is on 7.2 and Yii 2.0.13 by now we won't be keeping 
`1.0.*`-branch (pre PHP 7.2) up to date anymore. 

Please use version `1.1.*` or later.

## Features

### Powerful, yet Simple

* Installs as a simple module so it can be added without any hassle.
* You can either track specific actions and nothing else or exclude specific routes from logging (wildcard supported).
* View your data. The module contains a nice viewer that is automatically made available when you add it to your configuration. It has configurable permissions to limit access to this functionality by IPs, roles or users.

### Minimal Footprint

Tracks minimal data in the base entry:

* `user_id` - User ID of the visitor (if any), based on `Yii::$app->user->id`.
* `ip` - IP Address of the visitor.
* `request_method` - The method used to generate the request, eg: `CLI` for console requests and `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS` or `HEAD` for web requests.
* `ajax` - If the page was requested using ajax.
* `route` - The controller and action of the request.
* `duration` - How long the request took to serve.
* `memory_max` - The peak memory usage during the request.
* `created` - The datetime the entry was created.

### Log Data using Configurable Panels

Each panel is optional, and you can even create your own.

* `RequestPanel` - Tracks all incoming web and console request data:
  * URL Information including the route and params.
  * PHP SuperGlobals `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SERVER`, `$_FILES` and `$_COOKIES`.
  * Headers from the Request and Response.
* `AssetPanel` - Asset Bundles loaded for the request.
* `ConfigPanel` - Yii and PHP configuration that was used for the request.
* `DbPanel` - SQL queries.
* `ErrorPanel` - Record all PHP exceptions and errors in the background.  Once logged you can configure a cron task to email the errors to a developer so issues can be fixed before they are even reported by a user. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/error-panel/)
* `JavascriptPanel` - Automatically log JavaScript errors. Errors and warning are logged automatically by including `JSLoggingAsset` asset bundle.  The javascript component also provides methods to manually add logging entries. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/javascript-panel/)
* `LogPanel` - Yii logs.
* `MailPanel` - Emails that were sent during the request. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/mail-panel/)
* `ProfilingPanel` - Application profiling information.
* `TrailPanel` - Database changes that were made during the request using the `AuditTrailBehavior`. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/trail-panel/)
* `ExtraDataPanel` - Extra data that you want to store. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/extra-data-panel/)
* `CurlPanel` - Track your applications cURL requests (including replies, log and headers) [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/curl-panel/)
* `YourOwnPanel` - Create your own panel to capture any data you want. [more info](https://bedezign.github.io/yii2-audit/docs/custom-views-panel/)
