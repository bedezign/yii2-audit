## 1.1.2 November 1, 2019

So finally a release. 
It's long overdue, I know. Trust me, there are reasons for my absence, but I'll skip the excuses part and promise to try to do better from now on, even though it's impossible to give any guarantee.
There's tons more to do (like getting tests to work again etc), I wanted to get a new release out there first so everyone can go back to a stable version.

This module is now PHP 7.2 and Yii 2 2.0.13+ only. 

* Bug [#270](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/270): Make panels compatible with yii2-debug 2.1.6 and later
* Enh [#267](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/267): Use Yii2's namespaced migrations functionality
* Bug [#263](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/263): fix bs4 issues from yii2-debug
* Bug [#261](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/262): Fix "group by" exception on SQL Server  
* Bug [#246](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/246): fix when args missing from error trace
* Enh [#264](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/264): show the whole request url in entry view
* Enh [#259](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/259): French translation
* Enh [#252](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/252): Allow manual entry definition via `setEntry` function
* Enh [#251](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/251): Override Module::getInstance() to allow for derived Audit module classes
* Enh [#250](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/250): Added 'renderEmail' panel function detection to allow for custom email renderers (should still be tested, sorry, no data atm)

## 1.1.1 February 4, 2018

* Enh [#225](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/225): German translation
* Enh [#236](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/pull/236): Chinese translation
* Bug [#221](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/221): Verify component existence in the console, terminate execution with more flair if not.

## 1.1.0 January 20, 2018

* Enh [#231](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/231): This release is identical to 1.0.13 except that **it requires Yii 2.0.13** to make it compatible with PHP 7.2. It will still work on older PHP versions.

## 1.0.13 January 20, 2018

* Bug [#216](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/216): Migration failed for MSSQL on alter_audit_mail
* Enh [#219](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/pull/219): Refactored chart panels
* Enh: Use `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` as IP when it is set
* Enh [#217](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/pull/217), [#218](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/pull/218): Optimized database queries for panels
* Enh: Made `php-mime-mail-parser` optional (mail panel will now work without, with less functionality). This means you don't need the `mailparse` extension anymore to install Audit.
* Bug [#233](https://github.com/bedezign/yii2-audit/issues/233): Made DbPanel work with versions that have the [duplicate queries count](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-debug/pull/293)
* A new version will be released shortly (1.1.0) that will be PHP >= 7.2 and  Yii >= 2.0.13. As of PHP 7.2 `object` is reserved as a type hint keyword and thus the Yii `Object` class was renamed to `BaseObject`. For PHP < 7.2 a workaround was added that still provides an `Object` class. This means that Audit v1.0 will work for Yii >= 2.0.13, as long as you do not use PHP >= 7.2
